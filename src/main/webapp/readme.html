    <p>02 Apr 2015: At last added listener code that removes any unused or duplicate files from server and DB on sessionDestroyed.
        Added message if source analyzer cannot read source schema or example xml (some mappings had rdf files with extension .xml as source
        schema, for example Mapping2). Scroll editable block to top of page so that user does not get lost.
    </p>
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">March</h5>
    <p>27 Mar 2015: Added source analyzer functionality! Works with xml files at the moment.

        Fixed a nasty, hard to detect bug (when deleting one of multiple entries and shifting positions, input values were

        Added text in configuration tab.</p>
